## Pretrained weights for SFRSeg

SFRSeg was implemented in [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [keras](https://keras.io/), and pre-trained weights were saved as hdf5 files. 

Below is the link to a cloud folder that contains pre-trained weights

[https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/feEYJjVCGBj5wTU](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/feEYJjVCGBj5wTU)

* Cityscapes pre-trained weight
* KITTY pre-trained weight
* Camvid pre-trained weight
* Indoor objects pre-trained weight

Users not familiar with tensorflow/keras should consult relevant [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/save_and_serialize) to understand how to load pre-trained weights into a model.

## For train.py and predict.py scripts

For training and model's prediction using pre-trained weight, follow the instructions from the following GitHub repository:
