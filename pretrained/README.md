## Pretrained weights for SFRSeg

SFRSeg was implemented in [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [keras](https://keras.io/), and pre-trained weights were saved as hdf5 files. Below are download links for pretrained weights for different datasets:

[Cityscapes pretrained weight](https://cloudstor.net.au/123456)

[KITTI pretrained weight](https://cloudstor.net.au/123456)

[Camvid pretrained weight](https://cloudstor.net.au/123456)

[Indoor robot navigation dataset](https://cloudstor.net.au/123456) 

Users not familiar with tensorflow/keras should consult relevant [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/save_and_serialize) to understand how to load pre-trained weights into a model.
